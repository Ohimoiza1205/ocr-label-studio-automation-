# Reflection Write-Up

In this project, I selected key invoice fields such as Invoice Number, Invoice Date, Customer Name, Item Descriptions, Quantity/Unit Price, Tax, and Total Amount because these are critical for ensuring accurate financial processing and auditing. I excluded non-essential elements like logos and decorative graphics to focus solely on data-relevant information. One major challenge was dealing with OCR errorsâ€”some text regions were misaligned or misread due to low image quality. To address these issues, I manually refined the bounding boxes and corrected the transcribed text in Label Studio. For future improvements, I recommend incorporating an image pre-processing step to enhance contrast and clarity, as well as establishing a standardized checklist for labeling. This would streamline the process, reduce manual corrections, and ultimately lead to higher quality datasets for training robust AI models.
